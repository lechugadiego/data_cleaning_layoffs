# Data Cleaning using MySQL

## In this project I took "layoffs.csv", which included over 2000 entries, imported it into MySQL and cleaned the data.
## SQL queries located in "layoffs_cleaning.sql"

## Steps I took to clean
1. check for and remove any duplicates
2. standardize data and fix errors
3. Look at null values
4. remove columns and rows that are not necessary
